# $SOFA Governance token

The **$SOFA token is the governance token of the SOFA.org ecosystem**.  As a decentralized, non-profit, open-source technology organization, all decisions within the SOFA.org ecosystem are determined by votes from $SOFA token holders.

## Uses of the $SOFA Token

**As a pure governance token, $SOFA does not participate in any profit sharing within the ecosystem**.  Instead, it focuses on maintaining a healthy, long-term development of the SOFA.org ecosystem via governance voting decisions.

## Subject Matters Pertaining to Governance Votes:

1. Types of financial products to be onboarded
2. Determination of the eligible basket of supported collateral (USDT etc.)
3. Admission of new partner protocols into the SOFA.org ecosystem
4. Distribution mix % of daily $RCH airdrops between the various on-boarded products
5. Distribution mix % of daily $RCH airdrops amongst ecosystem protocols
6. Pace of $RCH airdrops
7. And other decisions to come as the ecosystem matures
