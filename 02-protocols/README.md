# Protocol Premise & Vault Taxonomy

SOFA.org will be **developing a series of standardized decentralized vaults** based on the underlying asset class, as well as their use-case pertaining to settlement, lending, and dynamic asset allocation.

Our core premise is to create the ability to** transfer dormant, chain-locked assets into partnering DeFi and CeFi venues **via the use of authentic** Position Tokens.  **This creates a secure form of **asset** **rehypothecation** that will **sustainably** **release significant liquidity** across the entire crypto ecosystem.
