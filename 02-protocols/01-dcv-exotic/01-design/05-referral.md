# Referral Model

> **Strength in numbers**

At SOFA, we recognize the importance of having a vibrant network of DeFi community members and partners to promote and ensure the long-term success of the protocol.  As such**, we have designed a referral reward mechanism aimed at growing both our individual and institutional partnerships** for the SOFA ecosystem.

## Operational Process

When users purchase products and mint positions through the SOFA protocol, **they can pass the referrer's wallet address as a parameter during contract interaction**.  In addition to facilitating ease of operations, this design promotes full transparency in referral rewards along with public recognition.

## Reward Calculation

**Referral rewards are calculated as a %-payout  based on the notional value of the positions minted by the end-user.**  The protocol automatically tracks these parameters and will airdrop corresponding $RCH tokens to the referrer's address post transaction execution.  Specific reward ratios and calculation methods will be publicly announced by SOFA, and will be subject to adjustments based on the platform's on-going governance decisions.

Similar to the usage-based airdrops, the implementation of this referral mechanism is done to incentivize true ecosystem users and supporters to continually expand the platform's user base.  The core focus remains to create a sustainable feedback loop that ensures a long-term win-win for all participants.  **SOFA**** views the referral reward system as a long-term investment and market development strategy**.

We are grateful and look forward to the involvement of our partnership friends and participants, and we will reciprocate by committing to provide full support and rewards to our valued ecosystem partners.
