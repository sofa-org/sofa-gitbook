# Protocol Fees

At SOFA.org, we are committed to creating a fair and transparent financial ecosystem where users can democratically invest in a wide gamut of structured products with transparent and fair pricing from market makers.  Furthermore, **as a fully decentralized project, we want to ensure that any protocol gains are primarily shared with our underlying users**, ensuring full incentive alignment rather than privileged payouts to special interest groups.  As such, we have devised a series of fee structures with **'fair-launch' tokenomics to ensure proper value-accrual and support long-term platform longevity**.  There will be no VC joy-riding or exit-liquidity dumps within SOFA.org.

## Protocol Revenue

> SOFA will collect 15% of the user's option premium as a base trading fee.  Furthermore, in the event of a 'winning' payout occurring for the user, a further 15% settlement fee will be charged against the total gross notional exposure.

Example:

- User purchases 10,000 USDT worth of Structured Products, maturing in 14 days at a price of 100
- Product pays out [Principal + 2% interest] as a worst case downside scenario
- AAVE APY = 10%
- Excess Interest = [10% - 2%] = 8% APY
- User Option Premium = 10,000 * 8% * (14/365) days = 30.68 USDT
- Market Maker Premium = 100 USDT
- **Base Trading Fee = 30.68USDT * 15% = 4.602USDT**
- **Settlement Fee = (30.68USDT + 100USDT) * 15% = 19.6USDT (only in the event of a winning payout)**
- **Total Protocol Revenue = 4.602USDT + 19.6 USDT = 24.202USDT**

## Native Token ($RCH) Buyback

> **Aligning protocol success with Token performance**

At SOFA, we believe that the **most straight-forward way to align user and hodler incentives are through token buybacks**, with $RCH being our native utility token.  We will **commit all protocol income to be exclusively used for $RCH buybacks**, creating a virtuous loop of token price gains being driven off protocol usage.

With a **fixed deflationary supply, methodical release schedule, and usage-driven airdops, the long-term value accretion for $RCH is largely a function of protocol revenue**, which in itself is a direct measure of adoption success.  Furthermore, with **Token airdrops exclusively limited to protocol users and supporters**, we can ensure that they stand best to benefit from SOFA's long-term success, staying true to DeFi's commerical ideals of 'giving back' to true core users and early adopters.

**The token buyback logic is an integral part of the SOFA protocol smart contract**.  Protocol administrators will regularly trigger this process to purchase and burn $RCH with protocol revenue through supported DEX venues.  Destroyed $RCH will be no longer enter circulation, and the total amount of $RCH will gradually decrease over time on rising protocol usage.

More details of our Tokenomics model will be covered in its own dedicated section below.
