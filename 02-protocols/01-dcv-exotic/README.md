# Executive Summary

- SOFA.org is a decentralized, non-profit, open-source technology organization that is **building a trustless DeFi ecosystem that can handle true atomic settlement of all financial assets** on the blockchain.
- Vital instrument parameters will be **immutably stored at the smart contract level**, allowing the creation of **authentic tokenized risk positions, representing secure and transferrable collateral claims** that are recognized on supporting DeFi and CeFi platforms.
- Most critically, **counterparty risks are effectively removed and transferred to blockchain vaults as a decentralized 3rd party custodian**, allowing users and intermediaries to conduct transactions without having to worry about asset safety.
- Furthermore, **capital inefficiency problems in DeFi are significantly improved** through the presence of transferrable Position Tokens, enabling a rehypothecable 'repo-like' market with secure 1:1 claims.
- **Initial dApp use-cases will revolve around Structured Products**, with strong ecosystem support from some of the industry's most reputable market makers, CeFi exchanges, and DeFi protocols.
- Platform users are directly rewarded through the native utility token $RCH, a **fixed supply deflationary token which can only be earned via protocol usage**.  Furthermore, all protocol earnings will be recycled to burn $RCH tokens daily, decreasing net supply steadily and accruing value gains directly to our user holders.
- Given its fixed and known supply release, **long term price accretion on RCH should be a direct reflection of SOFA's accumulated usage**, aligning price gains with usage metrics rather than inflationary gimmicks.
- The SOFA ecosystem is designed to be **fully extensible with other DeFi protocols and even centralized platforms**, offering boundless partnership synergies with lending partners, trading exchanges, stablecoin entities, and product issuers.
