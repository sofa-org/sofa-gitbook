# $SOFA Points

## $RCH Holder Distribution Plan

### Historical (Around October 10)

  - **Snapshot on October 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** A snapshot will be taken to record how much $RCH (including in earn) each wallet address holds. For every 1 $RCH held (Including Earn Product), 0.1 $SOFA Point will be awarded. The $SOFA Points for each address based on this October 1 snapshot will be recorded.

  - **Snapshot on September 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Another snapshot will be taken to record the amount of $RCH (Including Earn Product) each wallet address holds. For every 1 $RCH held, 0.1 $SOFA Point will be awarded. However, the total $SOFA Points earned in September cannot exceed the number awarded in October (meaning no points for $RCH sold before October).

  - **Snapshot on August 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Same as above, each address will receive 0.1 $SOFA Point for every 1 $RCH held. Again, the points for August cannot exceed the points received in October.

  - **Snapshot on July 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Each address will receive 0.1 $SOFA Point for every 1 $RCH held, with the same limitation: $SOFA Points earned in July cannot exceed the points earned in October.

### Future (Around November 10)

  - **Snapshot on November 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Another snapshot will be taken, awarding 0.1 $SOFA Point per 1 $RCH held (Including Earn Product).

    - For deposits held (14, 35) days: $SOFA Points = Amount of $RCH deposited \* price \* days \* 0.4.

    - For deposits held ≥35 days: $SOFA Points = Amount of $RCH deposited \* price \* days \* 0.6. (Not available yet, stay tuned for future updates)

  - Starting from September 20.

  - Every time a user buys $RCH surge, they will receive $SOFA Points.

  - Starting from September 20.

  - Each time a user deposits into non-$RCH Earn, they will receive $SOFA Points. The points are calculated as follows:

    - For deposits held (14, 35) days: $SOFA Points = amount of tokens deposited \* price \* days \* 0.04.

    - For deposits held ≥35 days: $SOFA Points = amount of tokens deposited \* price \* days \* 0.06. (Not available yet, stay tuned for future updates)

### Users Trading Surge With Other Tokens
  
  - Starting from September 20.

  - Each time a user buys non-$RCH surge, they will receive $SOFA Points.

    - $SOFA Points earned = amount of tokens deposited \* price \* 2.
