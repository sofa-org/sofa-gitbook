# $SOFA Points

## $RCH Holder Distribution Plan

### Updates

#### 2025/05/26

  - Update Dual trading rules

#### 2024/11/26

  - Update Automator trading rules

### Historical (Around October 10)

  - **Snapshot on October 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** A snapshot will be taken to record how much $RCH (including in earn) each wallet address holds. For every 1 $RCH held (Including Earn Product), 0.1 $SOFA Point will be awarded. The $SOFA Points for each address based on this October 1 snapshot will be recorded.

  - **Snapshot on September 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Another snapshot will be taken to record the amount of $RCH (Including Earn Product) each wallet address holds. For every 1 $RCH held, 0.1 $SOFA Point will be awarded. However, the total $SOFA Points earned in September cannot exceed the number awarded in October (meaning no points for $RCH sold before October).

  - **Snapshot on August 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Same as above, each address will receive 0.1 $SOFA Point for every 1 $RCH held. Again, the points for August cannot exceed the points received in October.

  - **Snapshot on July 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Each address will receive 0.1 $SOFA Point for every 1 $RCH held, with the same limitation: $SOFA Points earned in July cannot exceed the points earned in October.

  - **Snapshot on November 1, 2024, at UTC+0 00:00:** Another snapshot will be taken, awarding 0.1 $SOFA Point per 1 $RCH held (Including Earn Product).
