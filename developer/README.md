# Developer Documentation

The SOFA protocol is a completely open, inclusive, and non-profit blockchain project, and **we welcome any and all talented individuals to contribute to the on-going development of the SOFA ecosystem**.  With the exception of the protocol's core on-chain settlement and custody functions, all other aspects of the protocol are open to modifications and advancements by anyone else.

Such aspects include the front-end interface, matching services, or also being a participating market maker through our dAPP platform.  **Value-add contributors are eligible for $RCH airdrop rewards** as covered in the Tokenomics section.

Please refer to the following developer documentations for various technical specifics on how to get connected with our protocol.  We look forward to seeing a thriving SOFA community in the foreseeable future ahead.
